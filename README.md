# ETL_Project2

Description:
  This project included the Extraction, Transform, and Load (ETL) process to prepare data for analysis. 

## Data
   Source 1: https://www.kaggle.com/mariaren/covid19-healthy-diet-dataset
   <br>Source 2: https://data.world/csistare/alcohol-v-life-expectancy/workspace/file?filename=drinks.csv

## Data Cleanup & Analysis
 The extraction of from two sources as csv files. My transform process involved finding a common charactistic of the both data sets, searched for null values and converting data types, and double checking if data was ready for analysis.  Lastly, the load process was creating a database in pgAdmin with exact columns of the dataframe. 

## Project Final Report
  An overview of entire ETL process is the word document and jupyter notebook for the code.
